# Assignment 6 Project
This project was created for assignment 6 of The Data Science Toolbox course. There were three main topics:

## 1. Filename best practices
In general, filenames should be easy to process by the computer and easy to read and explore by a human. This means that a filename should ideally include both an easily readable human description of what is in the file, and metadata such as dates or tags that make it easy to parse for a computer. It's also very helpful to have files show up in a logical order when viewed in a file explorer or when listed in the terminal.

1. Be easy to read and informative to a human
2. Be machine-readable
3. Play well with default ordering

## 2. Project Organization
When it comes to organizing an entire project, it's even more important to structure files and folders in a logical and commonly accepted way. This is because there are several benefits to maintaining a standard project structure:

- Well-organized code is self documenting
- A new collaborator would immediately know where to look for specific things
- Your future self would find it much easier to reproduce your own results

## 3. Conda & Virtual Environments
A **virtula environment** allows us to install and manage various packages and versions of packages for our project without affecting other projects on our system (unless we specifically want to use the same environment).

**Conda** is an open source package and environment management system for any programming language.
